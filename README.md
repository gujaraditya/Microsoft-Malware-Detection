# Problem Statement
<p>
    In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to <b>identify whether a given piece of file/software<b> is a malware. 
</p>
<h2>1.4. Real-world/Business objectives and constraints.</h2>
  
1. Minimize multi-class error.
  
2. Multi-class probability estimates.
  
3. Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.
